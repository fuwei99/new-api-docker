# Custom New-API Instance with Model Prefix Feature

This Hugging Face Space runs a customized instance of the [New-API](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api) project.

## Key Features

*   **Always Up-to-Date:** Automatically clones the latest code from the `QuantumNous/new-api` repository on each build, ensuring you have recent updates.
*   **Custom UI Enhancement:** Includes a modified `EditChannel.js` from [timigogo/new-api-edit-channel](https://github.com/timigogo/new-api-edit-channel) which re-implements the "‰∏ÄÈîÆÊ∑ªÂä†Ê®°ÂûãÂâçÁºÄ" (Add Prefix with One Click) button on the channel editing page. This allows easy prefixing of model names with the channel name and generates the corresponding model mapping.
*   **Dockerized Deployment:** Uses the provided multi-stage `Dockerfile` for a clean and reproducible build process. The Dockerfile handles fetching code, replacing the file, and building both frontend and backend components.

## Usage

Once the Space is running, you can access the New-API web interface via the public URL assigned by Hugging Face. The application listens on port 3000 internally.

Use this instance as you would a standard New-API deployment. The primary difference is the added button functionality on the channel editing form.

## Technical Details

*   **Base Project:** [QuantumNous/new-API](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api) (Cloned automatically)
*   **Customization Source:** [timigogo/new-api-edit-channel](https://github.com/timigogo/new-api-edit-channel) (`EditChannel.js`) (Cloned automatically)
*   **Build Environment:** Defined by `Dockerfile`. The build process includes cache-busting techniques to ensure the latest code is fetched when the Space is rebuilt.
